# Quantum Relativity

**Replacing Einstein's second postulate with quantum action invariance to derive Standard Model structure from discrete 4D spacetime geometry.**

## Core Idea

Special relativity rests on two postulates:
1. Physics is the same in all inertial frames (relativity)
2. Light speed c is constant

We replace postulate (2) with: **The duration of action quanta is invariant**

This forces a discrete spacetime framework and makes c a *derived* consequence rather than an axiom.

## Key Results

### The Koide Formula from Geometry

The empirical relation for charged leptons:
$$Q = \frac{m_e + m_\mu + m_\tau}{(\sqrt{m_e} + \sqrt{m_\mu} + \sqrt{m_\tau})^2} = 0.666661$$

is **derived** from 4D hypercube (Q₄) geometry:
$$Q = \frac{1}{3}(1 + 2\cos^2 45°) = \frac{2}{3}$$

**Precision:** Theory matches observation to 0.001% (5 significant figures)

Heavy quarks also satisfy Q = 2/3 to 0.3%.

### Clifford Phase δ = 2/9

From Clifford algebra Cl₃ representation theory:
$$\delta = \frac{\text{spinor states}}{\text{interaction modes}} = \frac{2}{9} = 12.73°$$

**Empirical:** Phase extracted from lepton data = 12.6°

**Agreement:** 1%

### Parameter Reduction

- **Standard Model:** 12 fermion mass parameters (all inputs, no explanation)
- **This Framework:** 2 geometric constants (derived) + 5 scales = **12 → 5 reduction**

## What This Achieves

**Explains previously mysterious facts:**
- Why Q = 2/3 exactly (it's a 4D cube angle)
- Why δ = 2/9 appears (Clifford algebra structure)
- Why 3 generations (topology of π₃(SO(4)))
- Why these mass ratios (geometric projections)

**Makes testable predictions:**
- Heavy quark Koide precision improves → Q = 2/3
- Light quarks don't follow Koide (strong coupling)
- Cabibbo angle ≈ δ = 2/9 (within 2.4%)

## Status

**Proven:**
- Q = 2/3 from Q₄ geometry ✓
- δ = 2/9 from Clifford algebra ✓
- Empirical verification to sub-percent precision ✓

**Ongoing:**
- Complete lattice field theory construction

## Philosophy

**Standard Model view:** 26 arbitrary parameters we measure and plug in

**This view:** Physics is geometry. Particle masses reflect 4D spatial topology, not arbitrary constants.

The universe is a Q₄ hypercubic lattice. Everything else follows from mathematics.
